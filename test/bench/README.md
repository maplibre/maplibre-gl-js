# Benchmarks

Benchmarks help us catch performance regressions and improve performance.

## Running Benchmarks

Start the benchmark server with `npm run start-bench`.

To run all benchmarks, open [the benchmark page, `http://localhost:9966/test/bench/versions`](http://localhost:9966/test/bench/versions).

To run a specific benchmark, add its name to the url hash, for example [`http://localhost:9966/test/bench/versions#Layout`](http://localhost:9966/test/bench/versions#Layout).

By default, the benchmark page will compare the local branch against `main` and the latest release. To change this, include one or more `compare` query parameters in the URL: E.g., [localhost:9966/test/bench/versions?compare=main](http://localhost:9966/test/bench/versions?compare=main) or [localhost:9966/test/bench/versions?compare=main#Layout](http://localhost:9966/test/bench/versions?compare=main#Layout) to compare only to main, or [localhost:9966/test/bench/versions?compare=v1.13.1](http://localhost:9966/test/bench/versions?compare=v1.13.1) to compare to `v1.13.1` (but not `main`).  Versions available for comparison are the ones stored in the `gh-pages` branch, see [here](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-js/tree/gh-pages/benchmarks).

To run all benchmarks in headless chromium use `npm run benchmark`. As with the browser you can include one or more `--compare` arguments to change the default comparison, e.g. `npm run benchmark -- --compare main`. You can also run only specific benchmarks by passing their names as positional arguments, e.g. `npm run benchmark -- Layout Paint`.

## Running Style Benchmarks

Start the benchmark server

```bash
MAPLIBRE_STYLES={YOUR STYLES HERE} npm run start-bench
```
Note: `MAPLIBRE_STYLES` takes a comma-separated list of up to 3 MapLibre styles provided as a style URL or file system path (e.g. `path/to/style-a.json,path/to/style-b.json`)

To run all benchmarks, open [the benchmark page, `http://localhost:9966/test/bench/styles`](http://localhost:9966/test/bench/styles).

To run a specific benchmark, add its name to the url hash, for example [`http://localhost:9966/test/bench/styles#Layout`](http://localhost:9966/test/bench/styles#Layout).

By default, the style benchmark page will run its benchmarks against `https://api.maptiler.com/maps/streets/style.json?key=get_your_own_OpIi9ZULNHzrESv6T2vL`. `Layout` and `Paint` styles will run one instance of the test for each tile/location in an internal list of tiles. This behavior helps visualize the ways in which a style performs given various conditions present in each tile (CJK text, dense urban areas, rural areas, etc). `QueryBox` and `QueryPoint` use the internal list of tiles but otherwise run the same as their non-style benchmark equivalents. `StyleLayerCreate` and `StyleValidate` are not tile/location dependent and run the same way as their non-style benchmark equivalents. All other benchmark tests from the non-style suite are not used when benchmarking styles.

## Generating gl statistics

Build minimized production maplibre-gl-js with `npm run build-prod`.

Gather and output gl statistics from headless chromium with `npm run gl-stats`. The results are output to the terminal and saved in data.json.gz.

## Writing a Benchmark

Good benchmarks

 - are precise (i.e. running it multiple times returns roughly the same result)
 - operate in a way that mimics real-world usage
 - use a significant quantity of real-world data
 - are conceptually simple

Benchmarks are implemented by extending the `Benchmark` class and implementing at least the `bench` method.
If the benchmark needs to do setup or teardown work that should not be included in the measured time, you
can implement the `setup` or `teardown` methods. All three of these methods may return a `Promise` if they
need to do asynchronous work (or they can act synchronously and return `undefined`).

See the JSDoc comments on the `Benchmark` class for more details, and the existing benchmarks for examples.

## Interpreting benchmark results

The benchmark harness runs each benchmark's `bench` method a lot of times -- until it thinks it has enough
samples to do an analysis -- and records how long each call takes. From these samples, it creates summary
statistics and plots that help in determining whether a given change increased or decreased performance.

* **Mean**, **Minimum**, and **Deviation** are the standard summary statistics.
* **R2 Slope / Correlation** are measures derived from comparing increasingly large groups of samples (1 sample,
2 samples, 3 samples, ...) to the sum of those samples' execution time. Ideally, the number of samples is
perfectly linearly correlated to the sum of execution times. If it is, then the slope of the line is equivalent
the average execution time. But usually, the correlation is not perfect due to natural variance and outliers.
The R2 correlation indicates how good the linear approximation is. Values greater than 0.99 are good. Less
than 0.99 is iffy, and less than 0.90 means something is confounding the results, and they should be
regarded as unreliable.
* The top plot shows the distribution of samples, both by plotting each individual sample (on the right),
and by plotting a kernel density estimate. On the right, you can also see (from left to right) the mean,
minimum and maximum sample, and sample values at the first quartile, second quartile (median), and third quartile.
* The bottom plot shows the R2 analysis and resulting linear approximation.

## Posting benchmark results to PRs

We recommend installing a browser extension that can take full-page snapshots, e.g.
[FireShot](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/take-webpage-screenshots/mcbpblocgmgfnpjjppndjkmgjaogfceg).

Alternatively there is a suitable pdf at [`test/bench/results/all.pdf`](./results/all.pdf) after a successful run of `npm run benchmark`.

## GitHub Pages and the benchmarks

The benchmarks run in a browser. A website stored at `bench/versions/index.html` serves as a shell to load the benchmark code (which is in `benchmarks_generated.js`), run the benchmarks, and display the measurement results with some nice plots. The whole transpiled and minified library is stored in `benchmarks_generated.js`, so to compare different versions of the library the browser loads multiple `benchmarks_generated.js` files which are hosted in the GitHub Pages of this repository. Whenever a new version of MapLibre GL JS gets published, a new `benchmarks_generated.js` file will be created and uploaded to the GitHub Pages branch. See
