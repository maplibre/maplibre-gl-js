These integration tests verify the correctness and consistency of [maplibre-gl-js](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-js) and
[maplibre-gl-native](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-native) rendering.

## Organization

Tests are contained in a directory tree, generally organized by [style specification](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-style-spec/)
property: `background-color`, `line-width`, etc., with a second level of directories below that for individual tests. For example, the test for specifying a literal `circle-radius` value lives in [`test/integration/render/tests/circle-radius/literal/`](./render/tests/circle-radius/literal).

Within a leaf directory is a `style.json` file (e.g. [`circle-radius/literal/style.json`](./render/tests/circle-radius/literal/style.json)), which contains the minimal style needed for the given test case. The style can specify the map size, center, bearing, and pitch, and additional test metadata (e.g. output image dimensions).

The expected output for a given test case is in `expected.png`, e.g. [`circle-radius/literal/expected.png`](./render/tests/circle-radius/literal/expected.png).
There can be multiple files with the `expected` prefix since the output can vary slightly with each platform.

Supporting files -- glyphs, sprites, and tiles -- live in their own respective subdirectories of the [`test/integration/assets`](./assets) directory. The test
harness sets up the environment such that requests for these resources are directed to the correct location. For example, images in the `assets/tiles` subdirectory can be referenced using `"local://tiles/{z}-{x}-{y}.satellite.png"` in the `style.json` file.

The contents of vector tile fixtures can be read using the [`vt2geojson`](https://github.com/mapbox/vt2geojson) tool (see below).

## Running tests in GitHub

All tests are run for every PR. If you're not sure yet if the tests are good, you may use a Draft PR to indicate that the work is still in progress.
Each jos, or a group of tests, will create an artifact of any of its tests fail. The artifacts are found at the bottom of the jobs summary

<img width="80%" src="https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-js/assets/1304610/bc313a30-cdec-4de5-b6c9-90637ffbf79a" alt="" />

Download the appropriate artifact as a zip file, open it and view the `results.html` file it contains.
The "Actual" image of a failed test can be saved and used as the new "Expected" image.

## Running tests in the development environment

To run the render tests:

```sh
npm run test-render
```

To run the integration tests (except the render tests):

```sh
npm run test-integration
```

This includes the browser tests.

To run the build tests

```
npm run test-build
```

For running a subset of tests, you may use jest filters e.g.

```
npm run test-integration -- --testPathIgnorePatterns "/test/integration/(query|build)/"
```

Additionally, it may be helpful to use a visual jest frontend (e.g. `npx majestic`). Note that since render tests do not use Jest, these will still have to be run from the command line.

### Running specific tests

To run a subset of tests or an individual test, you can pass a specific subdirectory to the `test-render` script. For example, to run all the tests for a given property, e.g. `circle-radius`:

```
npm run test-render -- circle-radius
...
* passed circle-radius/antimeridian
* passed circle-radius/default
* passed circle-radius/function
* passed circle-radius/literal
* passed circle-radius/property-function
* passed circle-radius/zoom-and-property-function
6 passed (100.0%)
Results at: ./test/integration/render-tests/index.html
Done in 2.71s.
```
Or to run a single test:
```
npm run test-render -- circle-radius/literal
...
* passed circle-radius/literal
1 passed (100.0%)
Results at: ./test/integration/render-tests/index.html
Done in 2.32s.
```

### Detailed debug messages for render tests

Render tests are executed in browser, and by default console messages are hidden. If need to see them, please pass <code>--debug</code> parameter:
```
npm run test-render -- raster-masking/overlapping-zoom --debug
```

### Viewing render test results

During a render test run, the test harness will use puppeteer to drive real browser and create an `actual.png` image from the given `style.json`, and will then use [pixelmatch](https://github.com/mapbox/pixelmatch) to compare that image to `expected.png`, generating a `diff.png` highlighting the mismatching pixels (if any) in red.

By default render tests generate reports in <code>./test/integration/render/</code> directory:
```
npm run test-render
...
1211 passed (99.8%)
2 failed (0.2%)
Results logged to './test/integration/render/results.html'
```
...you can view the results graphically by opening the `results.html` file generated by the harness:

```
open ./test/integration/render/results.html
```

If want to skip the report, please pass <code>--skip-report</code> parameter
```
npm run test-render -- circle-radius/literal --skip-report
```

### Updating results of render test results

Note that the CI is running the render tests. If they fail, the `report.html` is uploaded as an artifact. This file can be download, opened in the browser and with right click - save the image the actual CI render test result can be stored as the expected image.

To run this manually you can use the following commands
On Linux:
```
xvfb-run -a UPDATE=true npm run test-render
```
On Mac:
```
UPDATE=true npm run test-render
```
Or on Windows with PowerShell:
```
$env:UPDATE=$true; npm run test-render
```

#### Notes on the query integration tests

In test/integration/lib/query-browser-jest.test.ts a web server is automatically started to expose static assets from the integration folder. In order to start a similar server manually, run:

```
npx st  -l --port 7357 -d test/integration -co
```

We currently run each test in a new tab. Alternatively we might gain some speed by clearing the webgl context instead, and running everything in one tab.

```
delete map.painter.context.gl;
```

The output for each test is a true/false, regarding whether the expected and actual output has deep equality. To get a better test output, we can use:

```
generateDiffLog(fixture.expected, actual);
```

## Running tests in the browser

Query tests can be run in the browser, the server for serving up the test page and test fixtures starts when you run
```
npm run start
```

### Running specific tests

A filter can be specified by using the `filter` query param in the url. E.g, adding
```
?filter=circle-pitch
```
to the end of the url will only run the tests that contain `circle-pitch` in the name.

### Build Notifications

The terminal window can be very noisy with both the build and the test servers running in the same session.
So the server uses platform notifications to inform when the build has finished. If this behaviour is annoying, it can be disabled by setting the following env-var
```
DISABLE_BUILD_NOTIFICATIONS=true
```

## Writing new tests

_Note: Expected results are always generated with the **js** implementation. This is merely for consistency and does not
imply that in the event of a rendering discrepancy, the js implementation is always correct._

To add a new render test:
1. Create a new directory `test/integration/render/tests/<property-name>/<new-test-name>`

2. Create a new `style.json` file within that directory, specifying the map to load. Feel free to copy & modify one of the existing `style.json` files from the `render/tests` subdirectories. In this file, you can add additional information to describe the test and expected outcomes using the [`description`](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-js/blob/11811ee4da938cb823a018b1301168d99aa4a74b/test/integration/render/tests/regressions/mapbox-gl-js%236706/style.json#L7) metadata field.

3. Generate an `expected.png` image from the given style by running the new test with the `UPDATE` flag enabled:
   ```
   UPDATE=1 npm run test-render <property-name>/<new-test-name>
   ```
   The test will appear to fail, but you'll now see a new `expected.png` in the test directory.

4. Manually inspect `expected.png` to verify it looks as expected, and optionally run the test again without the update flag (`npm run test-render <property-name>/<new-test-name>`) to watch it pass (enjoy that dopamine kick!)

5. Commit the new `style.json` and `expected.png` :rocket:

## Updating results of query-tests

You can update the expected results of query-tests by running them with with the `UPDATE` flag enabled, for example on Linux:
```
UPDATE=true npm run test-query
```
Check carefully if all changes are intended.

## Reading Vector Tile Fixtures

Read the contents of an entire vector tile

```
npx vt2geojson -z 14 -y 8803 -x 5374 test/integration/assets/tiles/14-8803-5374.mvt
```

Read the contents of a particular layer in a vector tile

```
npx vt2geojson --layer poi_label -z 14 -y 8803 -x 5374 test/integration/assets/tiles/14-8803-5374.mvt
```
