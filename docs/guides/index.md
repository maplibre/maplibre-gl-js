# Guides

This section of the docs' site is dedicated to some more complex examples and tutorials.
If you have something you would like to share with the community that is not straight forward and might be beneficial to others, this is the place!

Things that are short enough and/or with lower complexity are probably already in the [Examples](../examples/index.md) section, but if not, feel free to add there.

The process of adding examples or guides is pretty straight forward, see our `docs` folder in the [MapLibre GL JS repo](https://github.com/maplibre/maplibre-gl-js/tree/main/docs) for more information.
