This folder contains developer documentation for MapLibre GL. Put any diagrams you reference in the [diagrams](./diagrams) folder. If you use PlantUML, put the source code in `diagrams/*.plantuml` files and run `npm run build-diagrams` to generate SVG versions of them. There is also a [Visual Studio Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=jebbs.plantuml) for previewing them while you edit.
