# MapLibre Community Structure

MapLibre is a joint collaboration by many interested parties in GIS to ensure
maintained, free, open source, and vendor-neutral libraries to support display
and development of maps.

No single company or individual controls more than one vote. No single entity
has control over the development roadmap.

## Steering Committee

The steering committee has the rights to make decisions (via consensus or
majority vote) regarding the direction of all MapLibre projects.

### Committee Members (as of 2020-12-18)

(sorted alphabetically)

- Cl√©ment Gayvallet, Jones Magloire ([Jawg](https://jawg.io))
- Luke Seelenbinder ([Stadia Maps](https://stadiamaps.com/))
- Marcel Normann ([WhereGroup](https://wheregroup.com/))
- Petr Pridal, Petr Sloup ([MapTiler](https://maptiler.com/))
- Seth Nickell ([Ceres Imaging](https://www.ceresimaging.net))

## Notes


- The community is currently quite young and informal. We are working towards
  formalizing this structure, including adopting by-laws and forming an
  official organization if necessary.
- We cannot currently accept funds to support development, but if you or your
  company would like to meaningfully contribute in this way, please open an
  issue, and we can discuss options.
